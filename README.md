# Diversity at Mudd

The Diversity at Mudd site is intended to provide a home for diversity and inclusion resources at Mudd and the 5Cs. Youâ€™ll find links to various pages from the Consortium as well as the start of a set of articles written to provide an introduction to diversity and inclusion and related ideas for anyone unfamiliar or interested.

If you find any problems with the site, please open an issue on this repo or shoot an email to dbashir@hmc.edu
